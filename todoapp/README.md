React homework for today:
    Create a very simple todo list application using a form and the "submit"-event
    Make the page visually appealing
    Add a button to each todo-item allowing the user to delete that item from the list!
    Make it possible for the user to add a due date to each item
    Make it possible for the user to add a priority to each item
    Add a sort function that sorts the items by priority
