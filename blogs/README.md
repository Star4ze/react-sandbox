Create a new React project.     ✓

Design a basic UI for the blog application. It should have a 
header, a list of blog posts, and a form for creating a new blog post.     ✓

Create a state array that will store the blog posts. This
state should be initialized with a few sample posts for testing purposes.     ✓

Implement a component that displays the 
list of blog posts. Each post should have a title, author, and content.     ✓

Implement a component that displays the form for creating a 
new blog post. The form should have input fields for title, author, and content.        ✓

Add the ability to submit the form to create a 
new blog post. The new post should be added to the list of blog posts.       ✓

Add the ability to edit an existing blog post. When the user clicks on a blog post,
 they should have the option to edit it. The form should be pre-populated with the existing post's information.     !

Implement client-side validation for the form. Ensure that the user cannot submit an empty form.         ✓

Add some styling to make the application look presentable.

Implement authentication for the blog application, where users must log in to create or edit posts. You can use a hardcoded list of users and their passwords for this exercise.

Utilize the local storage API to store the authentication information.

Only authenticated users should be able to create new posts or edit existing posts.

Make sure that the application works correctly and is secure.

Submit the code  for review.

Note: This exercise is meant to be a challenge and may require some research and experimentation. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck!
